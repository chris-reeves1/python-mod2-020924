# modules

# libraries - such standard library. Can contain multiple packages and modules.
# Packages - directories of python modules.  
# modules - just python files. 

# many built in and held in memory. Others need to imported. Other also we can install.
# pip - is our package manager. 

# pypi.org

#import math

#number = 10

#answer = math.sqrt(number) # modulename.method(args)

#print(answer)

#import math
#import random

#def random_pi():
#    return math.ceil(random.randint(1,10) * math.pi)

#for i in range(5):
#    print(random_pi())

# just with desired objects to save memory

#from math import ceil, floor, pi
#from random import randint

#def random_pi():
 #   return floor(randint(1,20) * pi)

#for i in range(5):
    #print(random_pi())

# exercise:
# Create 2 files, one called dice.py - write a function that will
# generate a random numer between 1 and 6.
# in the second file import the dice module and simulate throwing 2 dice.
# print its result.
